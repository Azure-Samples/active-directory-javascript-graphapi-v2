# MSAL JavaScript Single-page Application using Implicit Flow

A simple vanilla JavaScript single-page application which demonstrates how to configure [MSAL.JS Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msal) to login, logout, protect a route, and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview).

**Note:** A quickstart guide covering this sample can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript).

**Note:** A more detailed tutorial covering this sample can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/tutorial-v2-javascript-spa).

> :information_source: This sample is using MSAL.js 1.x. See [this](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-v2) for a sample using MSAL.js 2.x with authorization code grant (w/ PKCE)

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**. See [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-core-samples/VanillaJSTestApp/app/ie11-sample) for an IE11-compatibility.

## Setup

1. [Register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that the application is enabled for the [implicit flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow).
2. Open the [/JavaScriptSPA/authConfig.js](./JavaScriptSPA/authConfig.js) file and provide the required configuration values.
3. On the command line, navigate to the root of the repository, and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies via npm.

## Running the sample

1. Configure authentication and authorization parameters:
   1. Open `authConfig.js`
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Application_Id_Here"` with your app/client ID on AAD Portal.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"` with `"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/"` (*note*: This is for multi-tenant applications located on the global Azure cloud. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript)).
   4. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here"` with the redirect uri you setup on AAD Portal.
2. Configure the parameters for calling MS Graph API:
   1. Open `graphConfig.js`.
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me"`.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me/messages"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages"`.
3. To start the sample application, run `npm start`.
4. Finally, open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Key points

This sample demonstrates the following MSAL workflows:

* How to configure application parameters.
* How to sign-in with popup and redirect methods.
* How to sign-out.
* How to get user consent incrementally.
* How to acquire an access token.
* How to make an API call with the access token.
