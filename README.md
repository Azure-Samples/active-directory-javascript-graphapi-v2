# MSAL JavaScript Single-page Application using Implicit Flow

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL.js v2](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser).

Check it out: [Vanilla JavaScript single-page application secured with MSAL.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-v2)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [main branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2/tree/quickstart), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
